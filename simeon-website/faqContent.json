  {
    "question": "What is a smart contract?",
    "answer": "A smart contract is a digital agreement that tracks, verifies, and executes the binding transactions of a contract between various parties. <br/><br/> The transactions that are part of the contract are automatically executed when predetermined conditions are met. These contracts are self-executing and reliable and do not require the actions or presence of third parties which means they are both fast and cost effective. Importantly, they cannot be changed, can be easily distributed, and are tamper-proof, as well as being safe due to encryption."

  {
    "question": "What can I do on Simeon Run?",
    "answer": "Simeon Run is a fast and easy way to use and run contracts on Bcc. You will find a selection of financial contract templates so you can pick the right smart contract for you. Once you choose a template, you simply add in roles and terms, and then run your contract. You will be using the prototype version of Simeon Run. "
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there more smart contracts coming in Simeon Run?",
    "answer": "You have the option to build your own contract using Simeon Build. Also, we will be creating more contract templates for users to try out and these will be added to the contract catalogue soon."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I make changes to my contract once it’s been set up?",
    "answer": "You can make changes to your contract at any time before it has started running. You can simply edit the fields for Roles and Terms. Once it has started running, all terms are set, just as they are with a traditional legal contract."
  },
  {
    "question": "Am I using real funds on Simeon Run?",
    "answer": "No, when you use Simeon Run you are using test funds to run and execute your contracts."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a limit on how many contracts I can run at once? ",
    "answer": "Good question. We are not imposing hard user-specific limits on the prototype, but may do so in Version 1.0 of Simeon Run. Keep in mind that there are limits on how many contracts and transactions our servers can handle simultaneously, but this is not user-specific at this time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I open a contract with someone outside of the Bcc blockchain? ",
    "answer": "As all transactions within these financial agreements occur between Bcc wallet addresses in Version 1.0, all agreements need to be made with someone who has a Bcc wallet. In future versions, we may support agreements on other chains, as technically speaking, Simeon is blockchain-agnostic."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I build my own financial smart contracts on Simeon Run? ",
    "answer": "At this time, you can set up financial agreements using an array of templates available on Simeon Market - a smart contract template library. If they want to, you can also build your own financial contracts on the Simeon Playground. You can then upload these to Simeon Market and run them on Simeon Run."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between Simeon Run and Simeon Build?",
    "answer": "Simeon Run is a new product designed for non-developer end users, serving  a broader audience. The Simeon Playground is for a technical developer audience where contracts can be built on the Playground and subsequently used on Simeon Run."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I get help with Simeon Run contracts?",
    "answer": "If you experience any issues, you can use the ‘Submit Feedback’ email form on the sign and we will help you. You can also help us to stress test Simeon further by signing up to our Simeon Pioneer Program to work with our team. We will be releasing details about this program soon."
