=== zerepoch-tx-plugin

This package contains the GHC Core to Zerepoch IR compiler ("the
Zerepoch Tx compiler"), and a GHC Core plugin which enables programs
to use it.

Because of the way plugins work, clients can use the functions in the
`zerepoch-tx` package to use the plugin, but will require an additional
dependency on this package.

`zerepoch-tx-plugin` is separated out from `zerepoch-tx` because it
depends on the `ghc` library, which is difficult in a number of ways.
Specifically, when cross-compiling, the plugin module needs to be provided
as a "native"-compiled module, not as a cross-compiled module. Due to
cabal's lack of support for cross-compilation, this needs to be accomplished
by external means, and the best we can do is ensure that we *don't* try and
compile this package cross -- hence why we recommend depending on it
conditionally.
