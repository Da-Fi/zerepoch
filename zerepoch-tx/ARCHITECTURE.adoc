=== `zerepoch-tx`

This package provides several things:

- The Zerepoch Tx compiler, which compiles GHC Core into
Zerepoch IR.
- Functions for triggering the compiler plugin from `zerepoch-tx-plugin`.
- A couple of special typeclasses which aid with the interface
between Haskell and Zerepoch Tx, and Template Haskell support for
generating instances.
- A partial replacement Prelude, since many parts of the
normal Haskell Prelude cannot be used with Zerepoch Tx.
